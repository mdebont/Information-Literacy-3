    "# A1. Exploring your research topic\n",
    "\n",
    Introduction
Take one step back, before you take one forward. That is what exploration is all about. You might know your topic, or what your supervisor has told you, or the papers you have read already in previous courses for example. But in the context of your thesis, we challenge you to start with a blank sheet: "If you didn't know anything, where would you start?"

This fresh perspective will help you discover gaps, understand the context you operate in and assess the reliability and relevance of the information that you will need. It might also make you more aware of the connection between your research topic and other disciplines. This wider perspective could enhance your ability to find relevant research for your own study.


Videos
In the videos Lisanne will explain what we mean by an exploration, and how this can help you. In the two walkthrough videos, she will walk you through the different steps with the help of an example.
