# Gather information

Welcome to the gathering! Letâ€™s discover how to use other researchers' findings and assess whether it is reliable and relevant to your own study. At the end of this module, you will be able to create a reliable list of articles that you intend to read, and you will be able to explain how they can help you during your thesis.

This module will be valuable at the start of your thesis, whether you start with some papers from your own supervisor, or when you need create a literature review, or when you must write a research proposal, or even when you just start to explore what your thesis will be about. The start of your thesis can be overwhelming, so the three topics in this module will focus on providing structure to the large amount of information that you can and will encounter.
